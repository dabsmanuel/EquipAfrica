      "TABE ASHU Sergio is a 22-year-old Master 2 student and a resilient Cameroonian entrepreneur who believes that successful businesses can be built by providing sustainable solutions to Africa’s most challenging problems. He grew up with them having little money after his father abandoned the family when he was only 5 years old. Financial support became difficult for his mum who couldn’t get a decent job due to lack of formal education. At the age of 14 he got kicked out of school for not paying his fees and he discovered he was to work extremely hard if he was to succeed. Later, he would organize tutorial sessions for his peers which helped him make a little money here and there. Though it wasn’t much, he knew there was an opportunity in what he was doing and that was when he developed the spirit of entrepreneurship. So, he asked himself, how can he contribute to eradicating poverty for others? And how could he use his story to inspire economic growth and empowerment of the continent? ...He then founded Excel Academy in 2018 to provide academic assistance to k-12 students and at the same time reduce unemployment by providing tutoring jobs to smart and hardworking graduates and undergraduates. Today, TABE ASHU Sergio is among the top 26 youngest entrepreneurs in Africa by the Anzisha prize of the African leadership in partnership with the MasterCard foundation and he employs over 65 graduates and undergraduates till date and serves as a source of inspiration to hundreds of young people in his community.",
